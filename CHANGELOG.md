- macOS CI fix for Playwright version extraction (grep pattern anchoring)
- Python 3.10 test compatibility with mock.patch resolution

### Documentation
- Claude Code skill: parallel agent safety guidance

- Research agents (Fast and Deep modes)
- Artifact downloads (audio, video, infographics, slides)
- CLI with 27 commands
- Comprehensive documentation (API, RPC, examples)
- 96 unit tests (100% passing)
- E2E tests for all major features

### Fixed
- Audio overview instructions parameter now properly supported at RPC position [6][1][0]
- Quiz and flashcard distinction via title-based filtering
- Package renamed from `notebooklm-automation` to `notebooklm`
- CLI module renamed from `cli.py` to `notebooklm_cli.py`
- Removed orphaned `cli_query.py` file

### ⚠️ Beta Release Notice

This is the initial public release of `notebooklm-py`. While core functionality is tested and working, please note:

- **RPC Protocol Fragility**: This library uses undocumented Google APIs. Method IDs can change without notice, potentially breaking functionality. See [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) for debugging guidance.
- **Unofficial Status**: This is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google.
- **API Stability**: The Python API may change in future releases as we refine the interface.

### Known Issues

- **RPC method IDs may change**: Google can update their internal APIs at any time, breaking this library. Check the [RPC Capture](docs/reference/internals/rpc-capture.md) for how to identify and update method IDs.
- **Rate limiting**: Heavy usage may trigger Google's rate limits. Add delays between bulk operations.
- **Authentication expiry**: CSRF tokens expire after some time. Re-run `notebooklm login` if you encounter auth errors.
- **Large file uploads**: Files over 50MB may fail or timeout. Split large documents if needed.
